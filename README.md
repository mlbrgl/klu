# Serial task focuser for process-oriented, proudly mono-tasking ~~robots~~ mortals.

Klu might be for you if some of these apply:

- you enjoy mono-tasking
- you are pretty bad at juggling multiple commitments in your head
- you dislike multi-tasking but more importantly realised that you cannot 
- you want to feel at peace when working on that one important task (and the next, and the next ...)
- you want to do stuff, not constantly re-evaluate your priorities for every single task
- you would love it if your life was just a series of neatly compartmentalised processes (to some extent of course)
- you secretly tend to favour doing what feels good in the moment (aka quick wins)
- you look at a task and often think: "don't want to do it", "don't want to start it", "too difficult", "too big", "can't get bothered", "won't make it anyway", etc... (aka procrastination)

Klu is definitely not for you if:

- you find processes too constraining
- you are happy with the way you approach doing things at the moment, even if it implies keeping multiple commitments in your head
- you tend to jump from task to task without impacting your performance and emotional state

Klu does not require or use any external services. This is good news for privacy as your data never leaves your computer. On the other hand, you won't be able to access your data from another computer or device. This is partly by design (remember that point about compartmentalisation earlier) but also because that need hasn't really surfaced for me yet.

One thing you should also know is that there is no easy way of exporting your data just yet. This is not a shameless vendor lock-in, but simply a feature that hasn't made it to the top yet.
