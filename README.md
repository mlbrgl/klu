# Serial task focuser for process-oriented, proudly mono-tasking ~~robots~~ mortals.

Klu allows you to tackle your todos, favouring important over urgent. It does this by allowing you to arbitrary define important projects, how many tasks you want to address within those projects every day (contracts), while respecting external time constraints (start and due dates) **as well as your biological rhythm**. You end up with one task in front of your eyes, in big letters. No distractions. No endless lists. No stats. **Just your most important tasks, one at a time.**

You can check whether this is for you, read the full story behind it, as well as dive into Klu's core concepts [here](https://www.matthieubergel.org/klu.html).

## Installation
Klu only comes in the shape of a [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/klu/mgbcgeghbmhjgkenjpbiiipjeoaipike) at this stage.

## Stuff you might want to know
Klu does not require or use any external services. This is good news for privacy as your data never leaves your computer. On the other hand, you won't be able to access your data from another computer or device. This might change in the future.

One thing you should also know is that there is no easy way of exporting your data just yet. This is not a shameless vendor lock-in, but simply a feature that hasn't made it to the top yet.
